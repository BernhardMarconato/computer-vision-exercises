\chapter{Task}
For the second compulsory project of the lecture Computer Vision \cite{cv_lecture_ex}, a camera should be calibrated using two videos provided in the Moodle course, so any image of the camera can be undistorted. This is necessary because the camera used has a fisheye lens, so the outer areas of the image are distorted relatively strong.

Necessary goals of the task are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Providing all intrinsic camera parameters
    \item Providing the distortion coefficients
    \item Generating the undistorted images for at least four different images from each video
    \item Comparing original and undistorted images
\end{itemize}

The theoretical background is covered in the lecture and will not be explained in detail in this project documentation.
