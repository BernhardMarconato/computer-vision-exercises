\chapter{Task}
For the first compulsory project of the lecture Computer Vision, a document scanner should be implemented using the OpenCV library.

According to the exercise \cite{cv_lecture_ex}, for the scanner to work, a three step algorithm needs to be fulfilled:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Calculate the position of the four corner points.
    \item Use a perspective transformation to get a clean top-view of the document.
    \item Filter the scanned document to get a clear binary image.
\end{itemize}
