\chapter{Task}

For the first compulsary project of the lecture Computer Vision, a document scanner should be implemented using the OpenCV library.

For our scanner to work, we need to fullfil a three step algorithm:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Calculate the position of the four corner points
    \item Use a perspective transformation to get a clean top-view of the document.
    \item Filter the scanned document to get a clear binary image.
\end{itemize}
